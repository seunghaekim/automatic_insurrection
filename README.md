## Original Readme

The purpose of this little program is to expose the seductions of rhetoric, not to criticize actions taken.  Despite my admiration for many of the actions taken in the name of insurrection, I'm suspicious of how easy it is to substitute style for substance in the communiques describing these actions.  And this is not to say that all "insurrectionist" texts are meaningless, despite its difficulty, I found the Coming Insurrection to be, with all its excesses, a serious (if contentious) contribution to revolutionary thought.  And, to point out just one other exemplar, the recent "Communique from an Absent Future: The Terminus of Student Life" is by and large an excellent piece of analysis.  This program is intended only to demonstrate the pitfalls of language which sounds too good to be meaningful.
